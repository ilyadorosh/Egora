#### The Laravel Installer

Or, you may install the Laravel Installer as a global Composer dependency:

```nothing
composer global require laravel/installer

laravel new example-app

cd example-app

php artisan serve
```

Make sure to place Composer's system-wide vendor bin directory in your `$PATH` so the `laravel` executable can be located by your system. This directory exists in different locations based on your operating system; however, some common locations include:

<div class="content-list" markdown="1">
- macOS: `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin`
- GNU / Linux Distributions: `$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin` or `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin`
</div>

## Initial Configuration

All of the configuration files for the Laravel framework are stored in the `config` directory. Each option is documented, so feel free to look through the files and get familiar with the options available to you.

Laravel needs almost no additional configuration out of the box. You are free to get started developing! However, you may wish to review the `config/app.php` file and its documentation. It contains several options such as `timezone` and `locale` that you may wish to change according to your application.

#### Environment Based Configuration

Since many of Laravel's configuration option values may vary depending on whether your application is running on your local computer or on a production web server, many important configuration values are defined using the `.env` file that exists at the root of your application.

Your `.env` file should not be committed to your application's source control, since each developer / server using your application could require a different environment configuration. Furthermore, this would be a security risk in the event an intruder gains access to your source control repository, since any sensitive credentials would get exposed.

> {tip} For more information about the `.env` file and environment based configuration, check out the full [configuration documentation](/docs/{{version}}/configuration#environment-configuration).

## Next Steps

Now that you have created your Laravel project, you may be wondering what to learn next. First, we strongly recommend becoming familiar with how Laravel works by reading the following documentation:

<div class="content-list" markdown="1">
- [Request Lifecycle](/docs/{{version}}/lifecycle)
- [Configuration](/docs/{{version}}/configuration)
- [Directory Structure](/docs/{{version}}/structure)
- [Service Container](/docs/{{version}}/container)
- [Facades](/docs/{{version}}/facades)
</div>

How you want to use Laravel will also dictate the next steps on your journey. There are a variety of ways to use Laravel, and we'll explore two primary use cases for the framework below.

<a name="laravel-the-fullstack-framework"></a>
### Laravel The Full Stack Framework

Laravel may serve as a full stack framework. By "full stack" framework we mean that you are going to use Laravel to route requests to your application and render your frontend via [Blade templates](/docs/{{version}}/blade) or using a single-page application hybrid technology like [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com). This is the most common way to use the Laravel framework.

If this is how you plan to use Laravel, you may want to check out our documentation on [routing](/docs/{{version}}/routing), [views](/docs/{{version}}/views), or the [Eloquent ORM](/docs/{{version}}/eloquent). In addition, you might be interested in learning about community packages like [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com) and [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com). These packages allow you to use Laravel as a full-stack framework while enjoying many of the UI benefits provided by single-page JavaScript applications.

If you are using Laravel as a full stack framework, we also strongly encourage you to learn how to compile your application's CSS and JavaScript using [Laravel Mix](/docs/{{version}}/mix).

### Laravel The API Backend

Laravel may also serve as an API backend to a JavaScript single-page application or mobile application. For example, you might use Laravel as an API backend for your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application. In this context, you may use Laravel to provide [authentication](/docs/{{version}}/sanctum) and data storage / retrieval for your application, while also taking advantage of Laravel's powerful services such as queues, emails, notifications, and more.

If this is how you plan to use Laravel, you may want to check out our documentation on [routing](/docs/{{version}}/routing), [Laravel Sanctum](/docs/{{version}}/sanctum), and the [Eloquent ORM](/docs/{{version}}/eloquent).
